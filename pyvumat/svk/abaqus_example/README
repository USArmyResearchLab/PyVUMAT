This directory contains the files to run a simple Abaqus simulation with
PyVUMAT models.

Description of files:

1. example.inp - Abaqus input file. Simulates uniaxial compression in the Y
                 direction of a unit cube with 8 elements in Abaqus/Explicit.
 		 The material model is a user material (the VUMAT) with two
		 constants (Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio) and two state
		 variables. This material model declaration is consistent with
		 the analytical SVK and ML SVK implementations provided in the
		 PyVUMAT source.

2. run_abaqus.sh - Script outlining how to setup and run an Abaqus simulation
                   using PyVUMAT for the VUMAT material model.

3. pyVumat_Conf_svk.ini - Configuration file to run the analytical SVK model.

4. pyVumat_Conf_svkNN.ini - Configuration file to run the ML-based SVK model.
                            The user must modify the 'ModelFileName' keyword
			    with the path the saved PyTorch model.
